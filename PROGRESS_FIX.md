# Training Progress Fix

## Issue
When training progress exceeded the target (e.g., "12 / 10"), the training session would not end immediately, allowing users to continue beyond the intended target.

## Solution
Added immediate training session termination when progress reaches or exceeds the target.

### Changes Made

#### 1. TrainingInputDisplay.jsx
- Added a new `useEffect` hook that monitors `currentSession?.score?.totalInputs` and `currentSession?.targetInputs`
- When `totalInputs >= targetInputs`, the training session ends immediately
- Clears any active timers and calls `endTrainingSession()`
- Added `endTrainingSession` to the imports from `useTrainingStore`

#### 2. GameCanvas.jsx
- Added a `useEffect` hook to monitor when training sessions end and show the completion dialog
- Removed redundant progress checking from `handleInputForTraining` since TrainingInputDisplay now handles it
- The component now properly responds to training session termination from the child component

### How It Works
1. User performs inputs during training
2. Each successful input increments `totalInputs` in the session score
3. TrainingInputDisplay component continuously monitors the progress
4. When `totalInputs >= targetInputs`, the session ends immediately
5. GameCanvas detects the session end and shows the completion dialog

### Testing
- Created `progress-test.js` with test functions:
  - `testProgressExceedsTarget()`: Tests that training ends when progress reaches/exceeds target
  - `testProgressBelowTarget()`: Tests that training continues when progress is below target
- Tests can be run in browser console using `window.testProgressExceedsTarget()` and `window.testProgressBelowTarget()`

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/TrainingInputDisplay.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/GameCanvas.jsx`
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` (added test import)
- `frontend/src/test/progress-test.js` (new test file)

### Result
Training sessions now end immediately when progress reaches or exceeds the target, providing a better user experience and preventing confusion from continuing beyond the intended training goal.
