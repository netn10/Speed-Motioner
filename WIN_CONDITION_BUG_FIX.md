# Win Condition Bug Fix

## Problem Description
The game was registering as a win prematurely when one input after another was correct and the user did good the first input. This was causing training sessions to end before the user had actually completed the required number of input sequences.

## Root Cause
The bug was in the `TrainingInputDisplay.jsx` component in the `handleInputSuccess` function. The issue was that the code was calling `addInput(input)` for each input in a successful sequence, which was updating the game store's score tracking. This created a conflict where both the game store and training session were trying to track progress independently.

Specifically, when a user correctly performed a multi-input sequence (like "w+j"), the old code would:
1. Call `addInput(input)` for each input in the sequence (e.g., "w" and "j")
2. Then call `updateSessionScore(newScore)` which would increment `totalInputs` by 1
3. But the `addInput` calls from step 1 were also updating the game store's input tracking

This resulted in the progress being incremented multiple times for a single successful sequence, causing the training session to end prematurely.

## Solution
The fix was to remove the `addInput(input)` calls from the `handleInputSuccess` function in `TrainingInputDisplay.jsx`. The training session should handle its own scoring independently of the game store's input tracking.

### Changes Made

1. **Removed conflicting input tracking** in `frontend/src/components/TrainingInputDisplay.jsx`:
   ```javascript
   // REMOVED: This was causing the bug
   // Add each input from the successful sequence to the game store for combo tracking
   currentInput.forEach(input => {
     addInput(input)
   })
   ```

2. **Removed unused import**:
   ```javascript
   // REMOVED: No longer needed
   const { addInput } = useGameStore()
   ```

## How It Works Now
- When a user successfully completes an input sequence, only the training session score is updated
- The `totalInputs` counter only increments by 1 for each completed sequence, regardless of how many individual inputs were in the sequence
- The game store's `addInput` function is only used for free play mode, not training mode
- Training sessions now end correctly when the user has completed the required number of input sequences

## Testing
A test has been created in `frontend/src/test/win-condition-bug-fix-test.js` to verify that:
- Training sessions do not complete prematurely
- Progress is tracked correctly (1 increment per successful sequence)
- Sessions end only when the target number of sequences is reached

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/TrainingInputDisplay.jsx` - Removed conflicting input tracking
- `frontend/src/test/win-condition-bug-fix-test.js` - Added test for the fix

## Impact
This fix ensures that training sessions work correctly and users must complete the full number of required input sequences before the session ends. The bug was particularly problematic for multi-input sequences where users would see the session end after just one or two successful attempts instead of the full target number.
