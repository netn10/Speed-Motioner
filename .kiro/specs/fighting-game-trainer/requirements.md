# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A web-based training application that helps fighting game players improve their execution speed and accuracy for motion inputs (quarter-circles, dragon punches, charge motions, etc.) in a timed format similar to speed typing tests. The application will use React for the frontend interface and Flask for backend processing, providing real-time feedback on input accuracy and performance metrics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fighting game player, I want to practice motion inputs with visual prompts, so that I can improve my execution speed and accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a motion input prompt with visual representation (arrows/diagrams)
2. WHEN a user executes the motion correctly THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback (green indication)
3. WHEN a user executes the motion incorrectly THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback (red indication)
4. WHEN a motion is completed THEN the system SHALL display the next prompt within 500ms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a fighting game player, I want to see my performance metrics in real-time, so that I can track my improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a training session is active THEN the system SHALL display current speed (time per motion)
2. WHEN a training session is active THEN the system SHALL display accuracy percentage
3. WHEN a training session is active THEN the system SHALL display current streak count
4. WHEN a session ends THEN the system SHALL display final performance summary

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a fighting game player, I want different training modes, so that I can focus on specific skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting training mode THEN the system SHALL offer Drill Mode (single motion repetition)
2. WHEN selecting training mode THEN the system SHALL offer Mixed Mode (randomized motion prompts)
3. WHEN selecting training mode THEN the system SHALL offer Combo Mode (chained motion sequences)
4. WHEN a mode is selected THEN the system SHALL configure prompts according to that mode's rules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a fighting game player, I want adjustable difficulty levels, so that I can progress from beginner to advanced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting difficulty THEN the system SHALL offer Beginner (basic quarter-circles, dragon punches)
2. WHEN selecting difficulty THEN the system SHALL offer Intermediate (mixed complex motions)
3. WHEN selecting difficulty THEN the system SHALL offer Advanced (rapid sequences and cancels)
4. WHEN difficulty increases THEN the system SHALL reduce timing windows for input validation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a fighting game player, I want to use my gamepad/fightstick, so that I can practice with my actual hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a gamepad is connected THEN the system SHALL detect and recognize the controller
2. WHEN joystick input is received THEN the system SHALL parse directional movements accurately
3. WHEN button input is received THEN the system SHALL register button presses with correct timing
4. WHEN input is processed THEN the system SHALL validate motion within configurable tolerance windows

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a fighting game player, I want real-time input visualization, so that I can see exactly what I'm inputting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN joystick moves THEN the system SHALL display current stick position in real-time
2. WHEN buttons are pressed THEN the system SHALL highlight pressed buttons visually
3. WHEN motion is executed THEN the system SHALL show the motion path overlay
4. WHEN motion is incorrect THEN the system SHALL show comparison between expected and actual input

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a fighting game player, I want my training data saved, so that I can track progress over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session completes THEN the system SHALL save performance metrics to database
2. WHEN accessing history THEN the system SHALL display previous session results
3. WHEN viewing progress THEN the system SHALL show improvement trends over time
4. WHEN comparing sessions THEN the system SHALL highlight best performances

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a fighting game player, I want low-latency input processing, so that the training feels responsive like actual games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input is received THEN the system SHALL process it within 16ms (60fps)
2. WHEN motion is validated THEN the system SHALL provide feedback within 50ms
3. WHEN using WebSocket communication THEN the system SHALL maintain stable real-time connection
4. WHEN network latency occurs THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully without affecting training
