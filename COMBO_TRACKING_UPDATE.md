# Combo Tracking Update

## Problem
The original combo tracking system was incorrectly counting consecutive inputs rather than tracking the actual correct sequential inputs that match expected patterns.

## Solution
Updated the combo tracking logic to properly count only the sequential inputs that the user performed correctly according to the expected training patterns.

## Changes Made

### Backend (`backend/gameManager.js`)
1. **Updated `processInput` method**: 
   - Now only increments combo count when user correctly performs a complete expected input sequence
   - Resets combo when input doesn't match any expected pattern
   - Added `checkPartialComboValidity` method to check if current input is part of a valid pattern in progress

2. **Added `checkPartialComboValidity` method**:
   - Checks if the current combo is a prefix of any valid pattern
   - Allows partial matches to continue building the combo

### Frontend (`frontend/src/stores/gameStore.js`)
1. **Updated `addInput` method**:
   - Now validates inputs against training patterns before counting as correct
   - Only increments combo count when a complete valid sequence is performed
   - Resets combo when input doesn't match expected patterns

2. **Updated combo validation functions**:
   - `checkComboValidity`: Now uses the same training patterns as the training input display
   - `checkPartialComboValidity`: Checks if current combo is a prefix of any valid pattern

3. **Training pattern integration**:
   - Added support for all training modes (motion, blocking, punishing, combos)
   - Uses the same patterns as defined in `TrainingInputDisplay.jsx`

### Frontend (`frontend/src/components/TrainingInputDisplay.jsx`)
1. **Updated `handleInputSuccess` method**:
   - Now adds each input from successful sequences to the game store for combo tracking
   - Ensures combo tracking is synchronized with training completion

## How It Works Now

1. **Correct Combo Definition**: A combo is now defined as the sequential inputs that the user performed correctly according to the expected patterns for their current training mode.

2. **Combo Counting**:
   - Combo count increments only when user completes a valid input sequence
   - Combo resets when user inputs something that doesn't match any expected pattern
   - Max combo tracks the highest number of correct sequences achieved

3. **Training Mode Support**:
   - **Motion**: Single movement and attack inputs
   - **Blocking**: Block and direction+block combinations
   - **Punishing**: Single and double attack combinations
   - **Combos**: Multi-input attack and movement+attack combinations

4. **Visual Feedback**: The score display shows:
   - **Current Combo**: Number of correct sequential inputs in the current streak
   - **Max Combo**: Longest streak of correct sequential inputs achieved

## Example
- User performs: `w` (up) → `j` (attack) → `s` (down) → `j` (attack)
- In motion training: Combo count = 2 (two single inputs completed correctly)
- In combo training: Combo count = 1 (one up+attack combo completed correctly)
- If user inputs `x` (invalid): Combo resets to 0

## Testing
Created `frontend/src/test/combo-test.js` to verify the combo tracking logic works correctly across different training modes.
